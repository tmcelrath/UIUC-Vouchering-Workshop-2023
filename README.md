# What
Our 1st Vouchering and Digital Data Management workshop. Join us for one days of activities centered around vouchering both physical and digital specimens. This workshop will be interactive, modeled on some iDigBio workshops, like the Field to Database workshops, and will focus on equipping you not just to voucher specimens now, but also how to get the most return on investment in specimens, from your initial project to much more. As this is our first time offering this workshop, you'll be working alongside us to develop our curriculum and get your individual questions answered.
